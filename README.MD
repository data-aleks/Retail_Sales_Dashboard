## Key Insights From Data
The Holiday Performance and Reverse Logistics Audit evaluates the financial impact of fulfillment failures during the 2025 peak season. While major sales events like Black Friday achieved "Star" status with over $1.2M in net profit and 12% ROI, the broader holiday period suffered from significant profit erosion due to a 39.31% return rate and $1.72M in write-offs.

The audit identifies a systemic breakdown in the logistics network, where a 68.65% late delivery rate across all carriers was driven by a 1.3-day "Reality Gap" between promised and actual lead times. These delays directly contributed to high customer dissatisfaction, leading to a massive spike in return volatility that peaked in late November. Ultimately, with only 59% of returned goods suitable for resale, the data suggests that improving fulfillment accuracy is the primary lever for protecting future seasonal margins.
